WARMUP:

1. Create a folder called CookieWarmup, connect to Git/GitHub
2. Create the files index.html, app.js, display.html and display.js
  2.1. Link app.js to index.html and display.js to display.html
3. Link to the Cookies package in BOTH html files
4. Configure your debugger
5. In your index.html, create a button that asks the user to click
6. In your app.js file, write logic that does the following:
  6.1. Create a cookie called `click_count` and set it to 0
  6.2. Add an event listener that reacts to clicks on the button
  6.3. When the button is clicked: 
    6.3.1. Read the current value from the cookie
    6.3.2. Add one to this value
    6.3.3. Update the cookie to have the new value
7. In index.html, add a link that will take the user to the display.html page
8. In display.js, add the following logic:
  8.1. Reads the value from the `click_count` cookie
  8.2. Injects an h1 tag onto the page that tells the user how many times they have clicked the button
  8.3. If there is no value in the cookie, the user should just be shown 0 as the amount of clicks.
9. Modify the logic in the app.js file to only create the `click_count` cookie if it does not already exist.
10. Add two more buttons to the index.html page
11. Add click reactivity to each button
12. Apply the same logic as the first button to each button individually
  12.1. This means each button should get their own cookie!
13. Modify display.js to now show the amount of clicks for each button individually
  13.1. This means there will be 3 h1 tags inserted onto the page.
